# Hi there, I'm Fariz Shukri! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
**I have <mark style="background-color: #89CFF0">eight years of experience in the fashion industry</mark>, with a specialized focus on developing and implementing systems to identify counterfeit designer bags. In my role, I was responsible for designing and refining systems that accurately detect counterfeit products. This involved a combination of technological solutions, such as advanced imaging and authentication software, and manual techniques, including detailed analysis of materials, stitching, and branding elements. My expertise includes understanding the intricacies of various high-end brands, which allows me to pinpoint subtle differences between genuine and counterfeit items. I stay updated on the latest trends and methods used by counterfeiters to ensure that our systems remain effective and up-to-date.**
